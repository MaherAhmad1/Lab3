# Software
There are many types of software but the three we will be discussing within this unit are application, utility, and operating system software. Starting off with the first one, application software is primarily utilized to complete specific tasks such as calculations, spreadsheets, processing words, or just simply browsing the internet. An example of this kin dof software would be the application "Google Drive" because within it you can create documents and spreadsheets. Utility software is program that allows you to sort through, modify or arrange your computer to your liking. An example of utility software is "Windows Defender" which is a  program to help keep your computer safe from viruses. Lastly we are on Operating System Software (OSS). An OSS is the manager of all your hardware and system and makes it so that the interface does what you want it to do. Examples of OSS would be "Microsoft Windows", and "Apple Mac".
