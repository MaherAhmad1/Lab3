# Software
There are many types of software, but the three we will be discussing within this unit are application, utility, and operating system software. Starting off with the first one, application software is primarily utilized to complete specific tasks such as calculations, spreadsheets, processing words, or just simply browsing the internet. An example of this kind of software would be the application "Google Drive" because within it you can create documents and spreadsheets. Utility software is program that allows you to sort through, modify or arrange your computer to your liking. An example of utility software is "Windows Defender" which is a  program to help keep your computer safe from viruses. Lastly we are on Operating System Software (OSS). An OSS is the manager of all your hardware and system and makes it so that the interface does what you want it to do. Examples of OSS would be "Microsoft Windows", and "Apple Mac". There is one more type of software that we are learning about and that is ERP software. ERP is is Enteriprise Resource Planning, which was devoloped to make it so that organizations are able to use the software and make it utilize one central database that connects everything. An example of companies or organizations that use ERP is "Microsoft, Oracle, and Sap".


# Virtualization 
To explain what types of problems are solved by virtualization I would first like to define virualization. Virtualization is the "technology that lets you create useful IT services using resources that are traditionally bound to hardware". The problems that virtualization can solve are splitting a server into two unique ones so that they can run different tasks at once. This can be very useful for physical servers because instead of wasting space and being able to only run one program you can run multiple and use the servers powers to its full use. Hypervisors role in virtualization was that it was basically the early version of it. Hypervision made it so that multiple users could simultaneously access computers that can perform bathc processing, which is a computing style that runs routine tasks thousands of times very quickly.
